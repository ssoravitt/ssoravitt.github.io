I hesitated to review these books. My mind leans 80% toward not reviewing them. This is because readers of my review will get a glimpse of what I always think and say in my mind when talking to people.
The first book tells the story of Guido, a lawyer who has just gone through a breakup with his wife but is assigned to defend a murder case. The second book follows a similar pattern—it continues Guido’s life and legal cases.

If you ask someone to recommend this book, they might describe Guido as a loser. But I don’t think he is. He is just an ordinary person trying to meet society’s expectations but failing. Have you ever met someone who has never failed at anything? I have. They are infants.

I wouldn’t say Guido’s life is like mine, even though I just said he is an ordinary person—and so am I. Maybe my self-protection mechanism is denying this connection because I’m afraid you’ll see me as a loser. However, the sharp-tongued thoughts he often keeps to himself—I can’t deny that they are exactly like mine. Again, my self-protection mechanism kicks in, in which I believe that most people must complain about those around them in their minds, just like Guido and me.
