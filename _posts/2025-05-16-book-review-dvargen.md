Why does a dwarf, who is the main character in this book, identify himself as different from humans? This is a question that popped up in my mind many times while reading this book. Three weeks later, I wrote this review and still have been obsessed with this question.

Is it because the dwarf feels different from humans by nature, or do humans’ actions toward the dwarf make him feel different? I thought that this question can be applied to human lives no matter which era you live in. At least one time, you have felt different from other people. If so, it is worth opening your mind to read this book, even though you are not a dwarf and do not have brutal traits like the dwarf in this book.
