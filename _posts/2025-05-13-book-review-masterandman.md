I know that sexual desire motivates humans to take some actions, some of which are reasonable and some are not. Plenty of literature in the past, in my perspective, therefore used an erotic story to convey ideas of how the author understood human instinct and mind. The literature I review does too.

However, it is not the kind of literature where the main character feels lust and tries to do everything to have sex with someone in order to own them. Sexual desire in this literature is not like such cliché erotic literature, but it is a stimulus that activates something in your subconscious. Have you used your sexual desire as a stimulus like this? Have you explored your mind while you feel lust?

Using sexual desire as a stimulus is an attractive concept for me, although I personally feel cringe when reading such erotic work. However, I still recommend you read it. It is worth reading literature from the first Japanese Nobel Prize winner in Literature (1968).
