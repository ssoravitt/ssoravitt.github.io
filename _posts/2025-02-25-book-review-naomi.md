This book is about being a slave to love. Sometimes, I get bored with the concept, even though I know love is deeply rooted in human nature and is a reason behind many irrational human behaviors—just like what happens to the main character in this book.

The main character is attracted to a much younger woman from a minority background. From my perspective, he takes care of her not just to satisfy his sexual desires but also to use her as a way to display his power in society. However, people who think they are in control of someone are often the ones being controlled… We still see this kind of situation in the modern world.

Although I don’t believe in pure love—since I think we all have expectations of others in some way—and the book seems to imply this idea, I have to say it’s not my favorite. That said, one thing I admire about this book is that it feels like it was written in the last ten years, even though it was actually published in 1925 (if I understand correctly).
