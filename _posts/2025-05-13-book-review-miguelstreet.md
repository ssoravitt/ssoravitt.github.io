I like the feeling of reading old literature already published more than 50 years ago, but it makes me feel like I have read literature recently published in the last 10 years. This literature, Miguel Street, is one such book. You can embed yourself in this book easily.

It is because, no matter which era you live in, you always face the crazy people who dream high but achieve the lowest. I still question myself whether I should respect such crazy people because they dare to do it. Many times they are crazier without a good plan and self-evaluation, thereby their lives completely fail.

I am too lazy to elaborate on how I love this book because it requires more time to write it successfully. In short, this book has become one of my favourite books. If you asked me to recommend my five favourite literature, Miguel Street is one of them.
