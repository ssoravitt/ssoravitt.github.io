I brought my experience and the book’s contents together to conduct informal research on how people become rising-star innovators in their careers. I found that the book’s core concept—emphasizing the importance of knowing and connecting knowledge from different fields—is true. However, it’s not as easy as it seems. The book discusses crucial skills for connecting knowledge but, in my view, does not clearly explain them. Still, I think leaving room for thought is a good approach. A deeper discussion of these skills could extend into multiple books (For this point, I personally suggest that you visit my review of the book Where Research Begins.)

This is not a book that everyone loves because the author challenges the popular 10,000-hour rule, much like he did in his previous book, The Sports Gene. The book risks being misinterpreted by readers as discouraging consistent practice. However, the author never suggests giving up on practice. He strongly believes in consistent practice, but he emphasizes practicing the right lessons that align with one's unique talents. Humans possess more diverse talents across disciplines than they realize. The key is to keep exploring, practicing, and stacking your talents. This, he argues, is the best way to increase your chances of becoming a star in your career.

Finally, this is the first book I’ve ever read three times. The first time was in August 2021, but I can’t recall why I purchased and read it. I vaguely remember looking for a book that could reassure me during a time when I was questioning my potential. However, I couldn’t remember its content, and I hadn’t marked any sentences. Did it succeed in consoling me?

The second time, in January 2024, I read it accidentally. Between August 2021 and January 2024, both good and bad experiences helped me discover and accept my potential and identity. I couldn’t quite explain how I gained this understanding—but the book could. After leaving it untouched for a year, I returned to read it for the third time in January 2025, revisiting my markings. Now, I can honestly say this book is highly recommended. It has had the greatest impact on my life.
