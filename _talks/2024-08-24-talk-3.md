I was selected as one of the 19 finalists for Falling Walls Lab Thailand, a competition where participants pitch an innovative idea in just three minutes. The winner and runner-up would receive tickets to present their work at the Falling Walls Lab final in Berlin, Germany. Although I did not receive an award, I was proud to be one of the finalists who are from the natural sciences. This small success reinforced my belief that if I excel in my expertise—music cognition, even though it is a niche field—the world will recognize me.

The inspiration for my presentation came from the fact that music streaming services never ask how we truly feel at any given moment. For example, our sadness fluctuates throughout the day, week, or months, yet streaming platforms do not follow these changes. To better suggest music playlists that align with our current emotions, I proposed designing an interface for music streaming services that interacts with users, similar to ChatGPT. This interface would allow users to express their current feelings in detail, integrating this input with previous data and audio features to generate more accurate and personalized music recommendations.

This idea stems from my own frustration with finding music that truly fulfills my emotional needs. In a world where music for well-being is trending, I believe my proposal is crucial for using music to improve well-being in real-world scenarios. Not all music enhances our mood—choosing the wrong music can sometimes worsen a negative mood, leaving us feeling even worse for the rest of the day. However, listening to the right music can empower you to face a stressful world.
