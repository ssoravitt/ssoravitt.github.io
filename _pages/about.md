I am Soravitt Sangnark from Thailand, who has been pursuing many lifetime questions about music cognition, such as *How do humans respond to music across cultures?* *Why do humans enjoy music emotionally?* *How can music enhance well-being?* 


I started to pursue the questions once I found my master's thesis, music emotion recognition, which got me into the world of music cognition, which has increbibly changed my life. Thus, I got an opportunity to be currently like an independent researcher who conducts my own research about music cognition and physiological signals (EEG, ECG, and EDA), supervised by [Asst. Prof. Dr. Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U-L-iGIAAAAJ&hl=th) at [BRAIN Lab](https://brain.vistec.ac.th/), VISTEC, Thailand. 


If you have any questions, look for collaboration, and so on, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me via email (soravitt.sang[at]gmail[dot]com).
