I am Soravitt Sangnark from Thailand. I am pursuing many lifetime questions about music cognition, such as *Why are humans likely the only species emotional with music?* *How do humans respond to music across cultures?*  


I started to pursue the questions once I found my master's thesis, music emotion recognition, which got me into the world of music cognition. Thus, the thesis gave me an opportunity to currently conduct my independent research about music cognition and physiological signals (EEG, ECG, and EDA), supervised by [Asst. Prof. Dr. Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U-L-iGIAAAAJ&hl=th) at [BRAIN Lab](https://brain.vistec.ac.th/), VISTEC, Thailand. 


If you have any questions, look for collaboration, and so on, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me via email (soravitt.sang[at]gmail[dot]com).
