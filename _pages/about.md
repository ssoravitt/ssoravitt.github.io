I am Soravitt Sangnark from Thailand, who has been pursuing many lifetime questions about music cognition, such as *How do humans respond to music across cultures?* *Why do humans enjoy music emotionally?* *Why is popular music most memorable than others?* Absolutely, my research interests are music cognition and music information retrieval.
