I am Soravitt Sangnark from Thailand, who has been pursuing many lifetime questions about music cognition, such as *How do humans respond to music across cultures?* *Why do humans enjoy music emotionally?* *Why is popular music most memorable than others?* Without any doubt, my research interests are music cognition and music information retrieval, particularly cross-cultural music cognition.

> I believe --- I can make the world better through music cognition research.

My master's thesis, music emotion recognition, got me into pursuing the lifetime questions in the world of music cognition, which has increbibly changed my life. Currently, because of the thesis, I got an opportunity to be like an independent researcher who conducts my own research project about music cognition and physiological signals (EEG, ECG, and EDA, supervised by [Asst. Prof. Dr. Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U-L-iGIAAAAJ&hl=th) at [BRAIN Lab](https://brain.vistec.ac.th/), VISTEC, Thailand. At this point, I am confident --- music cognition is my life. 


If you have any questions, look for collaboration, and so on, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me via email (soravitt.sang[at]gmail[dot]com).
