I am Soravitt Sangnark from Thailand, who has been pursuing many lifetime questions about music cognition --- *How do humans respond to music across cultures?* *Why do humans enjoy music emotionally?* *Why is popular music most memorable than others?* Without any doubt, my research interests are music cognition and music information retrieval, particularly cross-cultural music cognition.

> I believe --- I can make the world better through music cognition research.

Although my formal role is called a research assistant, I am currently being like an independent researcher who conducts my own research project about music cognition and physiological signals (EEG, ECG, and EDA), supervised by [Asst. Prof. Dr. Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U-L-iGIAAAAJ&hl=th) at [BRAIN Lab](https://brain.vistec.ac.th/), VISTEC, Thailand. If you have any questions, look for collaboration, and so on, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me via email (soravitt.sang[at]gmail[dot]com).
